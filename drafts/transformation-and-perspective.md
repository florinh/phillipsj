# Transformation and Perspective

This is going to be a break from my typical style of post. I am going to share a little about the recent personal and professional journey that has occurred over the last two years. It will be a story about learning yourself, being introspective, and using that to change your perspective. I have found that is has improved my personal relationships and has helped propel my career in the direction that I want.

## Transformation

### Business Coaching
When I was first promoted to being a manager, I was blessed enough to be given the opportunity to receive business coaching. That was a great experience and had given me a set of tools to better cope and understand situations. It also helped me learn some items about myself.

### Industrial Psychologist

### Strength Finders

Roughly two years ago, my employer decided to send everyone that manages a team to a three day training with industrial psychologists. Part of that process was to do a self, peer, and direct report evaluation using their process called *need the name here*. Afterwards you were provided with an analysis of your personality and then you had time to see one of the psychologists for personal coaching.

## Perspective

After all of this, it is amazing the pure amount of perspective that you gain. You start realizing how much your actions impact others, even when not intended. You start feeling more in control against outside forces because you realize that all you can control is yourself and how you perceive situations.
