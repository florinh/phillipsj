# Deploying Dash to Elastic Beanstalk

Before I get started on how to deploy a Dash app to Elastic Beanstalk, I am going cover Dash. [Dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) is a Python framework for building dashboards using [Plotly](https://plot.ly/) for building your charts and graphs. Dash also uses [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

Since Dash is based on Flask, we can use the Flask Elastic Beanstalk preconfigured Docker container [tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_dockerpreconfig.walkthrough.html) as a reference, which we will discover hides some key pieces of information that we will need.

## Step 1: Create Dash Virtual Environment

As with any Python project, lets create a virtaul environment for our dash app. This tutorial will assume you are working on Ubuntu.

```
$ cd ~
$ python3 -m venv .venvs/dash
```

Now let us activate this virtual environment before we continue.

```
$  source .venvs/dash/bin/activate
```

## Step 2: Setup the project folder

Now lets create a folder and the initial files that we will need.

```
$ mkdir dash-example && cd .
```

Now let's make the two files that are necessary to get a basic Dash app up and running.

```
$ touch application.py
$ touch Dockerfile.local
```

That is it! We will only need these two files to get it working.

## Step 3: Install Dash packages and freeze

Now we just need to install our depedencies.

```
pip install dash==0.21.1 
pip install dash-renderer==0.12.1 
pip install dash-html-components==0.10.1
pip install dash-core-components==0.22.1
pip install plotly --upgrade
```

Now that those are installed, let's create our **requirements.txt** file.

```
$ pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

#### Special Note

*If you are running pip freeze on Ubuntu, your **requirements.txt** may end up with a package that will cause errors. Please search for **pkg-resources==0.0.0** and remove it from your requirements.txt.*

## Step 4: Build your Dash app

Now I am not going to be original here and we are going to use the example application found in the Dash tutorial, with some slight modifications that I will explain.

Open your **application.py** and add the following:

```
import dash
import dash_core_components as dcc
import dash_html_components as html

app = dash.Dash()
# Beanstalk looks for application by default, if this isn't set you will get a WSGI error.
application = app.server

app.layout = html.Div(children=[
    html.H1(children='Hello Dash'),

    html.Div(children='''
        This is Dash running on Elastic Beanstalk.
    '''),

    dcc.Graph(
        id='example-graph',
        figure={
            'data': [
                {'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [4, 1, 2], 'type': 'bar', 'name': 'SF'},
                {'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [2, 4, 5], 'type': 'bar', 'name': u'Montr√©al'},
            ],
            'layout': {
                'title': 'Dash Data Visualization'
            }
        }
    )
])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Beanstalk expects it to be running on 8080.
    application.run(debug=True, port=8080)
```

Save your changes and let's run it and see what we built. Run using the following command.

```
$ python3 application.py
```

Navigate to http://localhost:8080 and you should see the following.

# Step 5: The Dockerfile

Let's open the *Dockferfile.local* in your favorite text editor and add the following.

```
FROM amazon/aws-eb-python:3.4.2-onbuild-3.5.1
```

Yep, that is it. This pulls down the AWS beanstalk image that is preconfigured for Python applications. Let's be sure that it works by building the docker image and running it.

```
$ docker build -t dash-example .
```

Now let's run it.

```
$ docker run -it --rm -p 3000:8080 dash-example
```

Navigate to *http://localhost:3000/* and you should see this page again.
