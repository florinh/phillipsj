# Using or Contributing to Open Source at Work

Recently I have been having converstains about Open Source. The conversation ranges from why participate to how can I contirubte or use Open Source Software (OSS) at my job. At first it can seem like a lost cause, however I have succesfully done this three times at three different companies. The approach is much like the approach to DevOps, you have to start by having empathy and understanding for the other side, or better yet, realize there isn't an other side and that people are just making the best decisions based on the current information that they. With all that said, here is the formula that I have used to succesfully get movement in a positive direction.

** I am not a lawyer and this isn't legal advice, always seek legal advice from a professional in the field.**

## Step 1: Understanding Open Source Licensing

This is the least exciting one for some people, understanding OSS licensing is critical to the ability to make a cohesive argument and shows your willingness to learn what the legal team and other executives are going to ask about. The best place to start with understanding the different types of licenses would be the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/). They have a lot of great resources and I would encourage that everyone in OSS, heck even software, spend some time reading on their [licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses) page. Learn at least the popular licenses and the differences between them.

Understand that contributing to projects that don't have a defined license or a license that isn't OSI approved may put you and the company at risk. Since that increases risk, I typically stick to projects that use an OSI license and I do the same in projects that I create.

## Step 2: Contributor License Agreements

Make sure that you are educated on contributor agreements. There are lots of resources out there and the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) page is pretty good. It gives a very high level understanding of the concerns about copyright and why have a contributor license agreements. If you want to contribute to OSS while at work, then this is even more critical. This is here to project all parties, just like the license. These are good and shouldn't been seen as a negative. I have found that companies find these as positives and discussing these and how these work with a legal team is a good exercise for both parties.

## Step 3: Secret Sauce

Understand your company's secret sauce. It is always good to know what your company's executive and legal team see as the company's intellectual property. There may be other things that aren't so obvious that is consider keys to success that shouldn't be shared. Knowing this and showing your willingness to learn these items shows a level of maturity and that you are keeping the companies best interest in mind.

## Step 4: Preparing a Proposal

At this point, I assume that some knowledge has been gained. Conversations with management and legal team have occured and things are starting to look positive. Now comes to the time to take all this information and conversations that have happend and put them to paper. Yes, paper! Writing a proposal is key as it shows commitment to the people that will be reading it.

Here are the big sections that I have included in the several I have done.

1. What is Open Source
2. Value Delivered by Open Source
3. Benefits for using Open Source
4. Benefits of contributing to Open Source
5. Proposed Policies

Here is a high level of the types of things that I have put into each section.

### What is Open Source

This is a high level of what it is, philosphies, how it works, etc. This needs to be compelling and worded with a focus on the information derived from the conversations with management and legal. Keep it focused on the company mission and values.

### Value Delivered by Open Source

This one is always a little more difficult. I have tried to focus on security, robustness, who else uses it, etc. With the [Accelerate, State of DevOps Report]() you can now lean on some hard core research that outlines that top performing companies are using OSS. 

** Need that info in there**

### Benefits of using Open Source

This one can vary based on company values, yet including financial numbers is always a great approach. If you are currently using a piece of OSS, calculate how many hours would have been spend by a team to do it. Be conservative, but still make an estimation. A team of five with an average salary of 75k building a library that takes 40 hours would cost $7800 dollars. However, consider the cost like the CFO would and add 30% to that, so the total would actually be $10k. Show those types of numbers and don't hold back, being conservative still makes your point that if you used open source you could save $10k and actually have completed a new feature would would result an even bigger gain in value. Other, indirect financial benefits is faster time to market, lower cost of delay, etc.
